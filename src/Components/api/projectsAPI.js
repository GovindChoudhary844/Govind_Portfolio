        1. This is a 2D game where the player controls a gun that can shoot
        multiple balls.
        <br />
        2. Bubbles appear on the screen, each with a random number between 1 and
        9.
        <br />
        3. The balls bounce off the bubbles, and each hit reduces the bubble's
        number.
        <br />
        4. When a bubble’s number reaches 0, a pop animation is played and the
        bubble gets destroyed.
        <br />
        5. The game ends once all the bubbles are destroyed.

        <div className="resp-h2">Snake Rush – Multiplayer</div>
        <br />
        1. A real-time, competitive climb-'em-up where your snake races
        endlessly upward through a deadly wall of numbered blocks.
        <br />
        <br />
        2. Crash into a block and its value drops while your snake loses the
        same amount of body segments—strategy matters more than brute force.
        <br />
        <br />
        3. Collect glowing “body-part balls” scattered on the path; each ball
        carries a random integer that instantly grows your tail by that exact
        count.
        <br />
        <br />
        4. Grab lightning-bolt power-ups to enter hyper-speed: every block you
        touch vaporises in a single hit and its points are banked straight to
        your score.
        <br />
        <br />
        5. Blocks react visually—shifting hue from solid to cracked to
        crimson—as they absorb damage, giving instant feedback on how close they
        are to breaking.
        <br />
        <br />
        6. Score logic rewards aggression: the exact damage you deal to a block
        is added to your running total; when the level ends, every surviving
        segment delivers a bonus payout.
        <br />
        <br />
        7. Built for head-to-head rivalry: a sleek lobby lets two players join,
        countdown starts, then each contender has exactly 2 minutes 30 seconds
        to rack up the highest score.
        <br />
        <br />
        8. Session ends with a splash-screen crown for the winner and a
        one-click download link so you can keep the bragging rights forever.
